Known until recently as the Eliminate Dengue Program, the WMP uses naturally occurring bacteria called Wolbachia to reduce the ability of mosquitoes to transmit these viruses. Accumulating evidence is supportive of very large impact on disease transmission and large clinical trials and demonstration projects are currently underway.\n              \n              Following many years of laboratory research and field trials with promising results, the WMP has expanded to 12 countries worldwide and has widespread support from communities, governments and regulators. The World Mosquito Program has two regional hubs \u2013 our Asia hub in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, and Oceania hub, based at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia. As well as supporting projects in Vietnam, Sri Lanka, India and Indonesia, our Asia hub contributes to core global operations.\n              \n              The World Mosquito Program is working in partnership with Action on Poverty to protect communities in Vietnam from mosquito-borne diseases.\n              \n\n              JOB PURPOSE SUMMARY\n              \n              The Senior Contracts Adviser forms part of the Global Research Partnerships team within WMP.
