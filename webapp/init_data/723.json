We also need to connect with and manage the cost and quality of our third-party logistics providers. At the same time, we also support our FNA team to track all the cash spent or need to be collected to optimize the cash flow. All of those will ensure that our orders are processed and delivered to customers with a very short leadtime and optimal cost. This is a key differentiation that help Tiki to survive and grow fast in a tough market like Vietnamese e-commerce.\n              \n\n              In more details, you will:\n              \n              - Work with Product Owner to understand the requirement and build the product within aligned timeline.\n              \n              - Work with QC team to deliver bug-free product, build automation test.\n              \n              - Provide last-tier support for assigned product lines.\n              \n              We have a strong team with diversified background and a keen interest on being the best in e-commerce.
